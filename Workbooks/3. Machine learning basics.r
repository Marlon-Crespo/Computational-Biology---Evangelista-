#Work through the following tutorial. Copy and run the code necessary to complete
#the tutorial into this notebook. Note that some of the code they provide you
#has some intentional blank spaces. It will be up to you to fill them in.
#Their tutorial also suggests some other code to run and other things you can
#do with the data. Try them out. The more you practice the better you will be
#at coding in in R.
